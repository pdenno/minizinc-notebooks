We'll do that later if we actually use this sheet. The question for right now however is __How are you getting this data?__ It might be simpler for us to get it directly, calling a service on your MRP system. We should talk about this soon. But maybe get a prototype working with this stuff in the mean time."

Our scheduling problem might actually be easier than that; we might just have a sewing step, with all the separate operations summarized through the load balancing problem we solved above.
