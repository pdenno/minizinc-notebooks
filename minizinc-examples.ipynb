    "The goal of this notebook is only (1) to get you started with notebooks, and (2) let you see how MiniZinc can be interleaved with Python code. We won't try to learn much about MiniZinc here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are some instructions for installing Python, Jupyter, and Minizinc. I suppose that the first time you are reading this, you are looking at this file in the git repository. Once you have performed the seven steps below, you can read *and execute* this file in a Jupyter notebook. By the way, if these steps sound too arduous for students, check out [Jupyterhub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Jupyterhub is the best way to run Jupyter in industrial settings too. Note also that as of this writing, I've only tried these instructions on a mac. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. If Python isn't installed, install it now using whatever method seems best for your situation. Google for it. I am using Python 3.7. You can see whether you have python installed, and what version, by running `python --version` in a shell/cmd.exe.\n",
    "2. Pip or pip3 should have been installed as part of the Python install. Run `pip3 install jupyter` to install jupyter, a library of Python things for running Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "3. Install Minizinc from [here](http://www.minizinc.org/ide/). Note that MiniZinc has an IDE. We won't be using it here, though it is useful for debugging complex MiniZinc problems.\n",
    "4. Run `pip3 install iminizinc` to install the module for minizinc ipython magic. ipython is a command line implementation of Python that serves as the \"kernel\" for Jupyter. Jupyter kernels exist for many other programming languages.  Discussion of  iminizinc can be found in the [MiniZinc documentation](http://www.minizinc.org/doc-2.2.0/en/jupyter.html).\n",
    "5. Install git if you don't have it all ready. (Google for instructions.)\n",
    "6. Clone this respoitory (so that you have this file locally). `git clone https://github.com/pdenno/minizinc-notebooks.git` \n",
    "7. You are now ready to run this notebook! In a shell/cmd.exe change to the minizinc-notebooks directory and run `jupyter notebook`. If all goes well, the system will respond with something like this:\n",
